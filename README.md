# Cobe JavaScript test
Fork this repository and submit a link to it with your cover letter and CV!

There's no single 'correct' answer for these assignments, but elegant solutions gain extra points. The point of this exercise is to prove that you can learn unknown codebase and allow you to demonstrate your JS skills.

Writing unit or integration test is a great plus!

### Express task
Make a simple rest client. On backend you need to be able to save and retrive `User`. Its up to you to structure the app and to create all the necessary routes. Backend application needs to have:

* Rest routes for `User`
* `User` model that at least has `email` and `birthday` fields


### Angular task
Make a simple client side application that has a login screen and list of users.

Tasks you need to do:
* Structure the application inside the frontend folder
* Use task runners to make a production ready code
* Login screen with "login with google" button
* Authentification with [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent)
* Save a new user to the backend if he doesn't exist
* Only registered  users can access application!
* View for list of all `Users`
* View for single `User`

Environement: `bower`, `npm`, `gulp`, `UI-Router`, `SCSS`

Consider what COBE means, so try to make your apps accordingly :)
